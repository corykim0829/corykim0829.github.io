### canBecomeFirstResponder

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this object can become the first responder.

#### Declaration

```
var canBecomeFirstResponder: Bool { get }
```

#### Return Value

`true` if the receiver can become the first responder or `false` if it cannot.

#### Discussion

This method returns `false` by default. Subclasses must override this method and return `true`to be able to become first responder.

Do not call this method on a view that is not currently in the active view hierarchy. The result is undefined.



### inputAccessoryView

```swift
    lazy var redView: UIView = {
       let redView = UIView(frame: .init(x: 0, y: 0, width: view.frame.width, height: 50))
        redView.backgroundColor = .red
        return redView
    }()
    
    override var inputAccessoryView: UIView? {
        get {
            return redView
        }
    }
```



### isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement

A Boolean value that determines whether the stack view lays out its arranged views relative to its layout margins.



#### [알아두면 유용한 iOS의 LayoutMargins를 소개합니다! by 김태완 in Realm](https://academy.realm.io/kr/posts/ios-layoutmargins/)



#### Declaration

```
var isLayoutMarginsRelativeArrangement: Bool { get set }
```

#### Discussion

If `true`, the stack view will layout its arranged views relative to its layout margins. If `false`, it lays out the arranged views relative to its bounds. The default is `false`.
